                    <h4>Myers-Briggs test result</h4>
                    <img src="img/Myers-Briggs test.png" style="width:800px ;">
                    <p>You're an ENTP</p>
                    <p>You are an inspired innovator, motivated to find new solutions to intellectually challenging problems. You are curious and clever, and seek to comprehend the people, systems, and principles that surround you. Open-minded and unconventional,
                        you want to analyze, understand, and influence other people.</p>


                    <h4>learning style test</h4>
                    <img src="img/learning style test.png" style="width:800px ;">

                    <h4>Creativity test</h4>
                    <img src="img/Creativity test.png" style="width: 800px;">
                    <p></p>

                    <h4>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>
                    <p>These tests are all based on my behaviour. Then according to these tests, the company can get a preliminary understanding of my personal information. It's much better than a resume, and it's more persuasive. Through the test, I can
                        also show the company my own strengths, as well as my personal characteristics, as well as what I am good at. I can also use these settings to understand myself and have a clearer positioning for myself.</p>
                    <h4>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team? </h4>
                    <p>The results of these surveys will certainly affect the company's judgment on me. First of all, everyone has different characteristics. Then when communicating and assigning work, we should assign different tasks according to different
                        characteristics of each person. Instead of putting two people who are not good at talking together, the communication between them will become the biggest problem, even more difficult than the project itself, so in order to make
                        a team more efficient. These investigations are very necessary.</p>
                    <h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
                    <p>When we set up a team, we need to make the best of everyone's characteristics. For example, people who have strong leadership and family support are leaders. At the same time, there are some people whose communication ability is not
                        particularly good, and their understanding ability is not particularly good, but they also have a very strong ability to focus. When they are asked to serve as the R & D department or research some profound problems, their role
                        will be infinitely enlarged. So at this time, we need some partners with strong communication ability and empathy ability to communicate between groups. At the same time, we also need some team members with strong ability of discovery,
                        innovation and self-examination, who can help us understand ourselves and find our own problems. So a team needs people with different personalities and different characteristics to combine.</p>
