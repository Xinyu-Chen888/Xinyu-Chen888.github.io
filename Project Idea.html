                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>This is an online shopping tourism software based on Google map. When it is not convenient for people to go out, such as a rainstorm, sun exposure, special period (COVID-19), people can use this app to simulate travel, travel, and
                        make friends and chat. The app uses a 2D map and panoramic map technology, and the user controls a villain to move in the application. And it's moving at real speed. Chat with people on the same screen and even chat in the same
                        area.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Motivation </h4>
                    <p>During the covid19 epidemic, lockdown not only blocked the virus but also greatly affected people's social interaction. People stay at home, it's hard to make new friends, and they can't see the scenery around. People can only stay
                        at home and use traditional social software to make friends or watch photos outside, but traditional social software can't meet the real travel simulation, so we have this software. We hope that through this kind of friend-making
                        software that simulates real travel, people will be able to catch up with new friends and enjoy the scenery around them when they are blocked or hard to travel. During the covid19 epidemic, lockdown not only blocked the virus but
                        also greatly affected people's social interaction. It's not enough for people to stay at home and use traditional social software. This kind of friend-making software that simulates real travel may give people a glimpse.</p>
